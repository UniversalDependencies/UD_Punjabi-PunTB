# Summary
**PunTB** (a very imaginative acronym for **Pun**jabi **T**ree**b**ank) is an in-progress treebank of Punjabi in the Gurmukhi script, aiming to cover a wide range of genres and formats.


# Introduction
Currently the treebank is comprised of:

- 43 sentences from [IndicCorp](https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/corpora/) [source dataset found to be of variable quality, no more will be annotated]
- 28 sentences from the Facebook [FLoRes](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/flores/) low-resource machine translation dataset (with English translations)
- 71 sentences from Punjabi news articles.
  - [BBC Punjabi](https://bbc.com/punjabi): 2 articles, 64 sentences
  - [Jagbani](https://jagbani.punjabkesari.in/): 1 article, 7 sentences
- 33 sentences from Punjabi blogs.
  - [Punjabi Galbaat](http://punjabigalbaat.blogspot.com/): 1 article, 33 sentences
- 20 sentences from Punjabi editorials.
  - [Trolley Times](https://www.trolleytimes.online/): 1 article, 20 sentences

Only POS tags and dependency relations have been annotated so far. Automatic or semi-automatic methods will eventually be employed for morphological analysis and lemmatisation.
